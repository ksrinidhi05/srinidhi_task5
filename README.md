# Consumer Complaint Text Classification System

This project is a **complete pipeline** for classifying consumer complaints into four categories:

1. Credit Reporting  
2. Debt Collection  
3. Consumer Loan  
4. Mortgage  

It includes **data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction**.
